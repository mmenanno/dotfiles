# Cursor per‑repo rules

- Follow `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` as the authoritative repo guides.
- Prefer absolute paths in tool commands and references.
- For macOS/Nix changes, edit files under `nix/` (modules are in `nix/modules/system` and `nix/modules/home`).
- Validate changes with `nx check` or `nx c` before applying.
- Apply configuration with `nixup` or `nx up` (comprehensive nx script with short commands).
- Do not commit secrets; use 1Password CLI as described in `BOOTSTRAP.md`.
- Nix style: 2‑space indentation, small focused modules, hyphenated filenames.
- Shell scripts: `#!/bin/bash`, `set -euo pipefail`, pass shellcheck; markdown should pass markdownlint.

When assisting in this repo:

- Keep responses concise and skimmable; use fenced code blocks only for relevant snippets.
- Reference files/functions with backticks (e.g., `nix/modules/ssh.nix`).
- Default to declarative edits; avoid ad‑hoc manual system changes.
