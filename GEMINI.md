# Dotfiles Repository - Gemini Code Configuration

This file defines repository-specific Gemini instruction memory and behavioral preferences for working on this Nix dotfiles configuration. It extends the global `~/GEMINI.md` with dotfiles-specific requirements and overrides.

## Dotfiles-Specific Memory Context

### Repository Structure Memory

- Remember the modular Nix architecture (`nix/modules/system/` vs `nix/modules/home/`)
- Understand the relationship between flake.nix and individual modules
- Track successful patterns for Nix configuration changes
- Remember the purpose and scope of each module

### Dotfiles Development Patterns

- Remember successful approaches to Home Manager configurations
- Track effective patterns for system defaults and preferences
- Understand the interaction between nix-darwin and Home Manager
- Remember the bootstrap process and 1Password integration patterns

## Repository-Specific Workflow Integration

### Nix Development Memory

- Remember successful module refactoring patterns
- Track effective approaches to dependency management
- Understand the relationship between different package managers (Nix, Homebrew, mise)
- Remember patterns for managing secrets and environment variables

### Tool Integration Context

- Understand how AI tools are configured through this repository
- Remember the relationship between global and local configurations
- Track successful patterns for multi-tool AI setups
- Understand the MCP server architecture and shared configurations
